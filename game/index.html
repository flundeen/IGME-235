<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the <br>
earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase <br>
 you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to <br>
the point where they <strong>explode</strong>. [...]

	<blockquote> definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
