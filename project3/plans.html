        Chess Defenders
        Concept: is a chess survival type game with the introduction of a few new pieces as well. 
        There will be a variety of chess boards to select from as well. The player will have to 
        defend against mulptiple waves of chess pieces and be rewarded with pieces after completing
        each wave. 
        Genre: survival
        Story: Your kingdom is under siege so you must utilize your weapons you have to deter your attackers
        Aesthetics: The graphics would be kind of a rugged cartoon design. The pieces would be fairly simple 
        but there will still be a little bit of detail.
        Gameplay: The gameplay will be turned based in which the player will move a piece and then the attackers 
        will respond

        Unfortunately due to time cruch I was not able
