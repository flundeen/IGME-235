        <p>Swimming has been around for a very long time, being taught in the Greek 
            and Roman Empire. According to Britannica it was taught in martial training
            and treated with equal importance to the alphabet in elementary schools.
            It wasn't until the 19th century that swimming became both a recreational
            activity and sport. The reason for this was because authorities during the 
            Middle Ages equated swimming with being the cause for epidemics. The 
            first official swimming and diving facility was 
            founded in 1837 in London and consisted of six indoor pools with diving 
            boards. It wasn't until 1846 that the first swim championship was held in
            Australia. Swimming came to the United States in 1888 when the Amatuer 
            Athletic Union (AAU) officially recognized swimming as a sport.

        <h3>Doyou <br>know <div id="p2">How To <br>Turn?</div></h3>
        <p>
            Turns or "walls" are one of the most crucial aspects of competitive swimming 
            and can win or lose a race. Coming into the wall, a swimmer must 
            to their best to maintain their speed if not increase it coming into
            the wall. The importance behind this comes from keeping momentum 
            and adding power to your pushoff. Once you get to the distance that 
            best suits you to flip you should have both of your arms at your side, 
            which you can then use along with you legs to propel yourself into a 
            flipping motion until your legs land on the wall. As your feet hit the 
            wall, you should try to have your feet on the wall for the shortest time 
            possible, to create the most powerful and conservative pushoff you can.
            As you pushoff you will want your arms to snap into "streamline position", 
            which is when your stack your hands one on top of the other and then place 
            you elbows behind your ears. The tighter your arms are in this position the 
            faster your pushoff will be. After pushing off the wall, you will want to 
            begin your underwater kicks off the wall to upkeep the speed you brought into
            the wall.
