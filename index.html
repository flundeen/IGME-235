    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id = "bio">
        My name is Flynn Lundeen. I am from Reno, NV where I have previously lived for 17 years of my life.
        I am on the varsity swim team here at rit where I compete as a distance swimmer. Some of my other interests 
        include skiing, along with video games. My goal is to design games at my own studio. What I hope to
        get out of this class is a better understanding of the web along with a proficiency in HTML and CSS.
